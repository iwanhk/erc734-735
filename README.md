# ERC 734]35

This is an attempt at an implementation of [ERC 734](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/734) and [ERC 735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), following the specs as closely as possible. It uses the [Truffle framework](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) for testing.

## Overview

The smart contract implements the following features:

1. deploy contract using initial set of keys (`Identity.sol`)
2. add/remove keys to identity (`KeyManager.sol`)
3. get key data, in multiple ways (`KeyGetters.sol`)
4. "proxy contract" execution on the blockchain (`MultiSig.sol`)
5. multi-signature mechanism for MANAGEMENT_KEY and EXECUTION_KEY (`MultiSig.sol`)
6. add/remove claims to identity (`ClaimManager.sol`)
7. get claim data, in multiple ways (`ClaimManager.sol`)
8. refresh claims in identity (`ClaimManager.sol`)
9. ability to pause/unpause the contract, potentially with multi-sig (`Pausable.sol`)
10. ability to destroy the contract and return funds, potentially with multi-sig (`Destructible.sol`)

## Architecture

The implementation tries to make extensive use of Solidity patterns for modular code i.e. libraries, abstract contracts and multiple inheritence. Here's how the class diagram looks:

## Tests

Truffle tests exists for each contract, in separate files in the `test/` folder. Each tests tries to count how much gas it's using for setup and during the test. Also, at the end I'm printing out
total gas used for all tests.

```
$ ganache-cli --allowUnlimitedContractSize -l 10000000
...
$ truffle test
...
  âœ“ should be paused/unpaused by management keys (86435 gas)
	  Test only: 59,944 gas

  54 passing (1m)
```

Currently missing unit tests for events being emitted.

## Open issues

1. `uri` is not included in the signature and could theoretically be changed without changing a claim signature. Is this intentional or not?
1. Claim IDs are generated using `keccak256(address issuer + uint256 _topic)`, which doesn't work great for self-claims i.e. `issuer` is `address(this)` and we might want multiple self-claims with the same `topic`
1. Added an `ExecutionFailed` event in `ERC734]ich isn't part of the standard
1. For execution requests, I'm using the multi-sig threshold at the time of request, not the one at the time of execution - is that a good idea? (e.g. you request an execution, threshold is `X`, wait for approvals, threshold is increased to `Y`, initial execution is approval with `X` approvals)
1. Using [ERC 165](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/881) pseudo-introspection to check if an address implements ERC 734]735. Is this the best pattern for that?
1. Added a `PROFILE_TOPIC` claim topic which isn't part of the standard. The intended use is to store a plain-text profile URL in `data` (social media, blogs, etc.). As a convention, `uri` should be equal to `data`.
1. Added a `LABEL_TOPIC` claim topic which isn't part of the standard. The intended use is to store a plain-text label in `data` (real name, business name, nick name, brand name, alias, etc.).
1. The "proxy contract" only supports `.call`, doesn't support `.delegateacall` or creating a new contract on behalf of the identity.
